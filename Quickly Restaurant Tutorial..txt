Customize your kitchen preferences
KOT Settings
KOT settings are the preferences for how you want to send Kitchen Order Tickets (KOTs) to your kitchen. You can send KOTs to the kitchen in two ways: First, using the Kitchen Display System (Kitchen Display App), and second, through Kitchen Print (Printing KOT).
Kitchen Display System
The Kitchen Display System is often preferred for its real-time updates and efficient communication between the front-of-house and back-of-house staff. It reduces the reliance on paper tickets, minimizes the risk of misplaced orders, and helps streamline the kitchen workflow.


If you select Kitchen Display System, you can send your order/s taken from Sales & Billing app to the Quickly Kitchen Display (App) and your kitchen staff will get a notification about the order. He can also see the detailed order in the Kitchen Display, accept the order and mark the order as done when the dishes are ready. 


To enable Kitchen Display System,
                           1. Go to Kitchen > KOT Settings under the Sales & Billing module. 
                           2. Select Kitchen Display System (Quickly Kitchen Display)
                           3. Select the user/s you want to receive the notifications in Sales & Billing app.
                           4. Click on Save.
`  


Note that you have to download the Quickly Kitchen Display app to use Kitchen Display System.




Kitchen Print
Kitchen printing is a traditional and time-tested method used by many establishments to manage orders in their kitchen. In this approach, when an order is placed, a physical Kitchen Order Ticket (KOT) is automatically/manually printed in the kitchen area. The printed ticket contains all the relevant details of the order, such as the items, quantities, modifications, and any special requests.


This tangible format allows kitchen staff to have a physical copy of the order, which they can refer to and work with as they prepare the dishes. The printed KOTs might be attached to the corresponding plates or cooking stations, or they could be placed on a designated board for easy visibility and organization.


If you select Kitchen Print, you can print your order/s taken from Sales & Billing app through a printer connected to the app and send the physical copy of the print to the kitchen. The kitchen staff will see the ordered items containing all relevant details and make the dish ready.


To enable Kitchen Print, 
                           1. Go to Kitchen > KOT Settings under the Sales & Billing module. 
                           2. Select Kitchen Print.
                           3. Mark the check box if you want to see the kitchen logs.
                           4. Select one of the options (Change List or Full Order) how you want to print any changes in KOT.
                           5. Click on Save.


  

Monitor your kitchen activities with Kitchen Log
Maintaining a kitchen log can promote better communication, organization, and compliance with food safety regulations. It provides a historical record that can be valuable for audits, quality control, and continuous improvement in the kitchen's operations.


As a restaurant owner, you cannot oversee your kitchen all the time. Quickly allows you to monitor your restaurant’s kitchen activities from Kitchen History in real time.


You can see ongoing kitchen orders, prepared dishes, and track any mismatched orders that are prepared but not served, for any date range.


Note that you can see the orders in Kitchen Log that are sent to the Kitchen Display App and printed through Kitchen print if the log is enabled.


  



Customize kitchen configuration 
You can customize kitchen configuration to optimize the kitchen's performance and deliver exceptional dining experiences to its customers.

Attach Category
You can attach categories to the kitchens you create. By attaching categories to the kitchens you create, you can better classify and organize them based on their specific attributes and functions. These categories help provide a clear understanding of the purpose and characteristics of each kitchen, making it easier for you to identify and select the most suitable kitchen for your needs. 


To attach categories,
                           1. Go to Kitchen > Configuration under your Sales & Billing module.

Assign User
Assigning a user to the kitchen typically refers to designating specific roles or responsibilities to individuals who work in the kitchen. Each staff member is assigned to different positions based on their skills, expertise, and the needs of the kitchen. The assignment of roles in the kitchen is essential to maintain order, efficiency, and effective teamwork. Each staff member plays a crucial role in contributing to the overall success of the kitchen and ensuring that dishes are prepared and served to meet quality standards and customer expectations.

After adding dishes to the cart, you can assign the type of service you’re going to provide to your customers for each and every order. If your restaurant is providing dine-in, takeaway, restaurant delivery, and food delivery service all together, you need to check them all from the Order Identification page of your business portal. You can set your preferences according to your restaurant’s policy of providing service.

If your customer calls you and wants food to deliver to them using the restaurant’s own delivery service, then select Restaurant Delivery from the Order Info page. You can set the delivery charge from the business portal or you can set it from the Sales & Billing app after selecting the service type “Restaurant Delivery”. You have to enter customer’s phone number, name & address in the details.
Note that if the order originates from e-Restaurant, the order type will be automatically set as "Restaurant Delivery," and the customer's details will be populated based on the information provided by the customer while ordering. Moreover, the delivery charge will be included according to your e-Restaurant preferences set by you.

Calculate changes with built-in calculator
Quickly Sales & Billing App helps you to know the remaining to a customer after closing an order. For example, if the net payable is 16.25 and the customer gives you 20, the app calculates the change and shows that you have to give the customer 3.75 back.


                           1. Go to Settings
                           2. Turn on Change Calculation, you will find under “Others”.

The list of all the available payment modes will be showing up from where you need to select the modes and the amounts to pay the total bill (including/excluding the payment charge).


                                          


Collect and redeem reward points
If you set your Loyalty Program in the business portal, then customers can get benefit from the program when placing orders through the sales & billing app. The customers need to put their contact details when placing the order and reward points for that order will be added to the portal against those unique contact numbers. You can check the reward points at the business portal’s Loyalty Program page.


After generating the bill, click on the Proceed button to move forward.






At this stage, provide the contact number to the customer information section.






If the customer contact details has been already added for any earlier order, the name, email, address and the available reward points will be updated automatically. If the customer wishes to use the loyalty points, then click on the Redeem button.


For example, the total payable amount is showing ৳500 for an order and the available loyalty points for that contact is 260, which is equivalent to ৳26. If the customer wants to proceed without using the loyalty points, then he/she has to pay ৳500. On the other hand, if he/she wants to use the reward points, click on the Redeem button.






After redemption of the reward points, the total payable amount is now ৳1138 ( ৳1200 - ৳62). Now select the payment mode and complete the order.






The reward points for the current order will again be added to the system and will be available to use for the next order.
