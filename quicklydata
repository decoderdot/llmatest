Fazla Rabbi Mubin, Owner
CheeseBelly Restaurant & Cafe
Restaurant
I would say, Quickly Restaurant is a complete package. It doesn’t
require much effort to use and I can get a glimpse of my restaurant's
performance just from my smartphone. So, I never felt that someone
else is doing my job, feels like Quickly is working as a reflection of
me.

Mahi Khaan, Co-owner
নাওয়াবীয়ানা-The Legacy Remains
Restaurant
First time I heard a brief of the software, I felt like this is
exactly what I need for my restaurant. Since using it, I got nothing
but better results. The platform is extremely user-friendly. It helps
me to track my sales in an organized way with accuracy. So I don’t
have to fully depend on my manager anymore.

Saifuddin Mohammed Tarek, Provider
RomRoma
Retail
Though I didn’t want to invest in a software at first. But after
trying out the 1st month for free, Quickly Retail has become a
necessity for me. With its help, I can track sales & manage inventory
effortlessly. And the amount of time saved doing the day end
calculations is enormous. It actually saved me from hiring an
employee.

Salman Karim,Co-Owner
Central Café & Sophia Eateries
Restaurant
Satisfied and in love with the app. The experience is so smooth and
easy with the app. Being a small businessman, Quickly's
pay-per-as-you-go pricing model suits me perfectly. I am using Quickly
for my two restaurants in Cumilla. I would recommend Quickly to all
cafes & restaurants out there. A big shout out to Quickly. Thank you
for bringing in a solution like this!!

13TH JUNE 2019
When it comes to choosing a good Point of Sale (POS) system, it can be
great stress because it’s a one-time thing. If your point-of-sale

placing the order and reward points for that order will be added to
the portal against those unique contact numbers. You can check the
reward points at the business portal’s Loyalty Program page.
After generating the bill, click on the Close Order button to move

At this stage, provide the contact number to the customer information
section.
If the customer contact details has been already added for any earlier
order, the name and the available loyalty points will be updated
automatically. If the customer wishes to use the loyalty points, then
click on the Redeem button.
For example, the total payable amount is showing ৳120 for this order
and the available loyalty points for that contact is 12, which is
equivalent to ৳12. If the customer wants to proceed without using
the loyalty points, then they have to pay ৳120. On the other hand,
if they want to use the reward points, click on the Redeem button.
After redemption of the reward points, the total payable amount is now
৳108 ( ৳120 - ৳12). Now select the payment mode and complete the

Most of the time, restaurants face two problems with their inventory
management system- overstock & out of stock. So having a balanced
stock item in the inventory is very important for a restaurant
business.
Now let’s get started with the Inventory module to explore all the
exciting features available.

HOW TO ADD NEW ITEMS TO YOUR STOCK?

HOW TO ADD NEW ITEMS TO YOUR STOCK? 
Admin 
 _ 
 _ 
In order to add new items to your stock, you need to create some
categories first, so that the items could be organised well. For a
restaurant, we need to stock so many things and here I’m giving you
an example about how you can stock some grocery items in your
inventory. Suppose, you want to stock some spices (turmeric powder,
chilli powder, garam masala, and so on), all of which can be added in
one category “Spices”. This is because, whenever you need to
re-stock some specific items, you can easily find them searching by
categories.
👉 Click on Stock Items from the Items dropdown list which will
bring up a page containing all the items already created for different
categories.
👉 The items written in red are not stocked yet or need to restock.
Created items’ details can be viewed clicking on the Details button
right next to that item and can be edited as well. If you don’t want
any item to stock anymore, then uncheck the checkbox and it will be
moved to the inactive mode. Stock items can be filtered by status
(active/inactive) and stock groups. You can search the items by its
name, quantity, unit, avg price, and so on. If you wish to keep your
stock details in an excel sheet, simply click on the Export to Excel
button. If you want to download the stock report, simply click on the
download button from the right corner of the page.
Now, let’s create a new category to stock items in your inventory.
Click on Stock Groups from the stock items page which will bring up a
page with a list of stock groups if you have created any.
Stock group details can be edited and if you don’t want any group to
be active, then uncheck that stock group. Click on +New Group to
create a new stock group.
👉 Provide a meaningful group name and description, and make sure
the active checkbox is ticked. Finally, click on the Create or Save
and Create Another button.
👉 Now, as your stock group is created, let’s create some items
for the group. Click on the +New Item button to create a new item for
a group.
👉 To create an item, at first you need to select the group in which
you want your item to be, then provide a name, select the unit type
(quantity/weight/length/volume), check the active checkbox and click
on the Create or Save and Create Another button. Set the reorder
quantity if you want to get updated about your stock at any time.

want to stock-in for, or you can directly type the item name in the
item search box.

SET HOW TO CALCULATE THE COST OF GOODS SOLD
Admin 
 _ 
 _ 
Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the
foods sold by your restaurant. This amount includes the cost of the
ingredients and staff directly used to prepare the food.
Knowing the cost of goods sold helps analysts, investors, and managers
estimate the company’s bottom line. So it is very important for you
to identify your COGS and try to keep it low so that your net profits
will be higher.
To calculate your restaurant's overall profit/loss, determine how you
want to calculate the cost of goods sold from Preferences.
ADD VENDOR CREDIT
For the completed orders and wastage, the cost of goods sold will be
added to the expense list at the end of each day. This will be
calculated based on the preparation cost of the dishes.
You can manually set the preparation cost when creating a dish or use
the auto preparation cost, which is calculated based on the recipe.
To create a recipe for a dish, read how to create recipes.
IMPORT FROM INVENTORY
You must enable the Inventory module first before proceeding with this
preference.
The stock-ins will be added as expenses and the refunds will be added
as revenues.
To create a new stock-in, read how to stock-in items to the inventory.
To add a refund, read how to adjust damaged or refundable items to the
inventory.
MANUAL EXPENSE ENTRY
Apart from these two methods, you can also manually enter your
expenses and keep track of the cost of your goods. For example, you
can create recurring expense plan and generate those expenses as your
COGS each time you purchase groceries for your restaurant.
Please note that, selecting any one among these 3 options will disable
the other two. For example, if you select option 3 then even if you
have preparation cost set in the Sales & Billing module and/or items
stocked-in in the Inventory module, those values will not be counted
as your COGS.

fields: 
      Type: A
     Name: 
      To map a main domain (e.g. example.com), enter the full domain name
(example.com). If it doesn’t work enter @ 
      To map a subdomain (e.g. abc.example.com), enter the first part
(abc). 
      Value: 34.87.23.239
Save your changes in the DNS configuration page. In most cases, it
takes only a few minutes for these changes to take effect, but in some
cases it can take up to several hours, depending on the registrar.

Promotional activities are a great way to attract customer attention.
For retail businesses, in order to stimulate your potential customers,
offers (i.e discounts, buy1 get1 free etc.) for a limited time works
the best. 
In our software, you will see three types of promotions- offer,
membership, promo. 
👉 Simply navigate to the Promotions option of the portal and click
on the one you want to provide for your customers.
SET UP OFFER
In the offer page, you’ll find all the offers you have created. You

conditions of the offer). 
Set the time period for the offer providing the Starting Date and
Ending Date along with the Starting Time and Ending Time. If you have
a minimum order value to avail the offer then write it down the
Starting Price section. 
In case of a discount, you will get two Discount Modes- Amount and

customers who have the membership promotional offer available for them
then check on the membership applicable checkbox and the discount will
be applicable with the membership offer. 
Lastly, click on the create button.

more and refer to more people. So you may honor them by giving them
discounts and other offers.

amount as he wants and click the apply button.
You can switch on or off the option anytime you want.

according to each category (i.e tax of set menu can be 10% but tax of
beverage can be 0%). By clicking in the checkbox you can active or
inactive the vat in your products. If you check on the vat included
button, it means that vat is included in the price you have given and
will show vat included in the bill for all of your products. 
For example, when you set 20% sales-tax/VAT for ‘Xiaomi’ in the
portal, it will automatically be applied in the app.
